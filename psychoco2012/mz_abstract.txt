Title: Generalized measurement invariance tests for factor analysis

Authors: Ed Merkle, Achim Zeileis

Abstract: The issue of measurement invariance commonly arises in factor-analytic contexts, with methods for assessment including likelihood ratio tests, Lagrange multiplier tests, and Wald tests. These tests all require advance definition of the number of groups, group membership, and offending model parameters. In this talk, we construct tests of measurement invariance using individuals' scores (i.e., casewise gradients of the likelihood function) from the estimated factor analysis model. These tests can be viewed as generalizations of the Lagrange multiplier test, and they are especially useful for: (1) isolating specific parameters affected by measurement invariance violations and (2) identifying subgroups of individuals that violated measurement invariance based on a continuous auxiliary variable.  The tests are presented and illustrated in detail, along with simulations examining the tests' abilities in controlled conditions.  To carry out the tests, we use lavaan for model estimation, strucchange for testing, and some general methods for obtaining scores from lavaan objects.
