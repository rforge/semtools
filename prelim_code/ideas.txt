## Testing for Measurement Invariance along Ordered Categorical Variables ##
############################################################################

o Provide details for the idea briefly commented on at the end of the first
measurement invariance paper.

o Discuss specifically the (unordered) Chi-squared statistic and the
(continuous) max LM statistic and present the ordered categorical version
of the max LM statistic.

o Employ simulation to explore the power properties of the new test:
When the number of categories is low (3 or 4) it should be fairly close
in terms of power to the Chi-squared statistic. When it is very large
(>= 50) I would expect it to be close to the max LM statistic. In between
it should have clear advantages.

o Real application is needed to show the advantages in practice. A model
with an additional covariate of around ten categories would be good.

o efpFunctional objects with a linear model on artificial data are provided
in efpFunctional-cat.R

## Goodness-of-Fit Visualizations in Factor Models ##
#####################################################

o Explore goodness of fit on two levels: (1) on the level of the observed and
model-implied covariance matrix, (2) on the level of individual observations.

o For (1) the residuals(...)$cov from lavaan can be employed, most likely for
type = "normalized"/"standardized". These can then be simple plugged into
image() with a diverging color palette. Result can probably be improved by
re-ordering the variables by the tools in "seriation".

o For (2) one needs an observation-wise measure of deviation. One idea would
be to look at the log-likelihood contributions of each observation. If the
contribution is low, this signals a lack of fit. Possibly, this can be
suitably standardized by using an idea as in the deviance residuals in GLMs.

o An alternative for (2) would be the decorrelated and scaled empirical score
contributions. These provide a signed measure of deviation for each observation
and parameter. Additionally, one could compute the Euclidian norm for each
observation across parameters and graph this in a way similar to the plot
of Cook's distance in linear models.

o The question is whether this works well when there is a small group of
observations from a different model. This needs to be explored in simulations.
Possibly, the correlations are two large to get very clear-cut results.

o If it does, then one could also consider a heatmap-type plot as provided
in "seriation". Reorder both observations and parameters via hierarchical
clustering and present the result in a heatmap, probably again with a
diverging color palette.
